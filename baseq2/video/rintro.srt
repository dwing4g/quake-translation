Corporals Swampy and Wooley will take point position.

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's do this by the numbers folks, we
don't want any fender benders out here.

4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:15,932

00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:31,973
Fall back from orbit,
wait for retrieval.

22
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,890
GARFUNKEL
Why aren't the capital
ships bugging out?

23
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:51,630
DEIMOS
Something's very wrong here.

24
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,216
Power generators increasing
the planet's gravitation.

25
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,672
MARINE PILOT
Damn it, [unintelligible]

26
00:00:56,706 --> 00:01:00,110

We'll never make the
LZ. We're screwed!

STEPCHILD
Let's dust them.

31
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:11,172
DEIMOS
Attention all crew, we
are unable to break orbit.

32
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:14,044
They've somehow increased
the planet's gravitational pull.

33
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,402
Locate the disabled
generator at all costs.

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,396

our chance to take it down.
