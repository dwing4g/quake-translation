vault_logo_desc = "Quake II wasn't supposed to be a sequel. Other than the technology, the only thing Quake and Quake II have in common is the name and logo.  However, id needed to design the product packaging and they wanted to integrate the logo into the cinematic. After several failed attempts to come up with a name that was cool and could be trademarked, id ran out of time, and opted to call it Quake II. The second nail was added to the Quake logo, and it was done. Quake would continue afterwards with Quake III: Arena, but it was designed to be a successor to the free multiplayer focused update of QuakeWorld, than a continuation of either Quake title."

vault_biggun = "Big Gun"
vault_biggun_desc = "The Strogg reach Earth by generating and traveling through a black hole. This assault on Earth is depicted in the 2007 release of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Quake II is the follow-up story of Operation Overlord, Earth's plan to travel through the black hole and destroy the generator using a massive airstrike. In the way, however, is a defense system called the Big Gun. The idea of the Big Gun was inspired by the 1961 movie, \"The Guns of Navarone.\" In the movie, a World War II commando unit is selected to take out massive Axis defense guns on the Island of Navarone. In Quake II, Operation Overlord is a large muti-target assault that includes destroying the Black Hole Generator, a Gravity Well, the Strogg Defense Fleet, and the Big Gun itself."

vault_hangar = "Hangar"
vault_hangar_desc = "Although the final version of the Hangar bares little resemblence to this original concept, the design for the Strogg defense aircraft that can be seen flying by were created from this piece.

vault_imperial_city_desc = "The core of the Stroggos civilization is the capital city of Cerberon. This highly defended complex is built into the base of an enormous crater, Crater Majoris. Between the northern plains and the southern sea of Stroggos, Cerberon contains the major defense, communication, and political controls for the Strogg civilization. At the southern tip of Majoris is a second crater called Crater Minor. Crater Minor contains the defense base complex for the city of Cerberon."

These first levels are pretty typical of Strogg military construction, but have seen some destruction as a result of Earth's counter-attack. The first level in the game has been expanded on in this release based on materials found in the Quake II development archive. A new outdoor area that fills in the area between the two sections of base, and connects to the stream in the original level was restored."

vault_weapon_sketches_desc = "Not a lot of concept art from this era of id has survived. These pieces were all found hidden among some old printed box art proofs as purely physical drawings. Quake II had the most concept art out of the early id titles, since cinematics had to be finished far in advance of the game. These weapon sketches go from earliest very quick scribbles to pencil shaded and inked versions. Many of these designs made it relatively unchanged to the final, while others look completely different. Among the sketches, the original concept for the Disintegator can be spotted, which would go on to be used for the expansion pack weapon, the Plasma Beam."

vault_doc1 = "Design Doc Excerpt 1"

vault_doc_desc = "Two pages from an otherwise missing design document, containing descriptions of the units and needed art assets. While the original Quake had most of the artists and level designers creating their own episodes in isolation, only to be pieced together at the end in different episodes, Quake II was planned from the start to have a more cohesive progression of levels. These pages, which were well-loved by evidence of multiple coffee mug rings, cover the City and Palace units, near the end of the game."

vault_strogg = "Strogg Sketch"
vault_strogg_desc = "A sketch of a Strogg that may have been originally meant to be the Jorg/Makron. The final design would feature the same idea of a smaller enemy inside a large exo-skeleton, however while the exo-skeleton certainly looks tough, the same cannot be said for its occupant."

vault_ocean = "Ocean"
vault_ocean_desc = "Stroggos' atmosphere is similar in composition to that of the Earth and has bodies of water and water vapor clouds, indicating that a hydrologic cycle persists, in spite of the Strogg's industrial activities.

vault_monorail = "Strogg Monorail"
vault_monorail_desc = "The Strogg are a heavily industrialized civilization, and their monorail system is evidence of this. It connects key facilities across Stroggos, hauling machinery, raw materials, and Stroggs themselves. Trains on their rail lines are often used as a device to allow the player to transition from one unit to the next while above or underground."

vault_texpaint = "Texpaint"
vault_texpaint_desc = "Texpaint was an internal tool created for the purposes of creating skin textures for models by drawing directly on 3D models. While artists have access to a wealth of tools today for dealing with complex UV mappings, tools were primitive back then, and tools like Texpaint helped the id artists create more complex models compared to the first title."

vault_area_map = "Stroggos Area Map"
vault_area_map_desc = "A marked up version of the Stroggos planet surface, as seen panned around during the cinematic sequences. Much of the 3d modeling and texture is low quality, as it was never intended to be viewed outside of the 320x240 cinematic videos. The path is roughly the path taken of the player throughout the main campaign."

vault_alphabet = "Stroggos Lettering"
vault_alphabet_desc = "The stylized Strogg alphabet, used throughout the game on various textures in the environment. The lettering was pulled from this example image, baked directly into the texture. Also included are some custom ligature pairs, some of which went unused in the final version."

vault_e3_lab = "E3 97: Lab"
vault_e3_lab_desc = "By June 1997, Quake II was in the process of switching game code from QuakeC, to native code. The version at E3 more closely resembles Quake II as we know it today, while internally a version of Quake II existed that more resembled the original game. This HUD using Quake 1 graphics can be seen in official screenshots as it was one of the last things to be implemented. Being shown in the midst of a major rewrite, the AI was simple and the player would often get caught up on walls and other surfaces."

vault_e3_campaign = "Playable: E3 97"
vault_e3_campaign_desc = "These are the original maps included in the trade show demo version of the game, modified to work on the final version of the engine.

vault_ects_campaign_desc = "A playable version of the maps included in the above build. These levels represent roughly three months of progress, as the game progresses towards being complete in November. Despite being so close to the end date, large changes in the levels can be observed."

vault_early_tech = "Early Technician"
vault_early_tech_desc = "An early version of the Technician, with a best attempt at fitting what the skin would have been at the time of development. This iteration of the Technician sported an array of prodding and grabbing tools, popping out and fidgeting about at random."

vault_early_flyer = "Early Flyer"
vault_early_flyer_desc = "A near final version of the Flyer, which would be completed ten days after this iteration. A simpler texture, and in-progress skin with a more mechanical take, while the final Flyer would take on more organic forms including a face."

vault_early_tank = "Early Tank"
vault_early_tank_desc = "The Tank was one of the earlier enemies created in Quake II. This iteration has in-progress skins and animations, but largely resembles the final version of the Tank."

vault_early_mutant = "Early Mutant"
vault_early_mutant_desc = "The Mutant originally was to be more of a bipedal enemy as the animations in this version show. Several alternate skins were prototyped, with this particularly red one chosen to display here. This version of the Mutant is dated as late as September 1997, less than two months before the final version."

vault_gnorta = "Gnorta"
vault_gnorta_desc = "The Gnorta is an enemy that was cut before a skin or animations were created. This model, with no skin or animations is all that remains. It appears to be an enemy with a turtle-like shell, and would scuttle low to the ground."

vault_shocker = "Shocker"
vault_shocker_desc = "The Shocker is another enemy that did not make it past an initial prototype model. It appears to integrate aspects of the Infantry, Gunner, and Berserker, however it is also unknown what role it may have served, and was seemingly cut relatively early on in development."

vault_early_blaster = "Early Blaster"
vault_early_blaster_desc = "This early iteration of the Blaster's first person view model featured a completely different silhouette, with sharper edges and a more traditional angled design. The less bulbous design create a much smaller weapon when viewed from the player."

vault_early_ship = "Early Strogg Ship"
vault_early_ship_desc = "An early version of a Strogg fighter ship, from before skinning of the model started. This model would stay relatively true to the final version, and is similar to the ship depicted in the \"Hangar\" concept art."

vault_early_male = "Early Male Player"
vault_early_male_desc = "This early version of the male player model is relatively close to the final version visually. Many of the animations would be unused however, with variants for swimming horizontally, elaborate death animations featuring lost limbs, and animations for pushing objects around in the environment. Quake III Arena would eventually feature unique swimming animations, however it is likely a lot of these animations went unused in Quake II due to time."

vault_early_female = "Early Female Player"
vault_early_female_desc = "An early mesh of the female player model, featuring a different hair style, and an early version of her silhouette."

vault_early_inf = "Early Infantry: Pale"
vault_early_inf2 = "Early Infantry: Camo"
vault_early_inf_desc = "Two skin variations of the Infantry that both map to the final model, a paler variation, and a camouflage skin. Both of these would go unused in favor of the final single skin."

vault_early_cg = "Early Chaingun"
vault_early_cg_desc = "The Chaingun went through a few iterations before being finished, including versions with visible hands. This one features a smaller barrel, but showing more of the gun's base itself, before eventually becoming just the larger, higher resolution barrel. The Chaingun's design would ultimately be finalized in June 1997, making this one of the earlier examples of a weapon new to Quake II."

vault_early_sg1 = "Early Shotgun 1"
vault_early_sg2 = "Early Shotgun 2"
vault_early_sg3 = "Early Shotgun 3"
vault_early_sg_desc = "Three variations of the in-progress Shotgun skin, dated from June 1997. Different textures were being tested, before settling on the cooler tones, without the rust texture. This texture would then be refined, with drawn on lighting, and lights to increase visual interest along the side of the gun."

vault_unused_fighter = "Unused Fighter Ship"
vault_unused_transport = "Unused Transport Ship"
vault_unused_ships_desc = "Two unused types of Strogg ships. Not much is known about the intended use of them, and dates on the files suggest that they may have been intended for a post-release expansion pack."

vault_unused_items_desc = "Player inventory and upgrades were originally intended to be a bigger part of the game. The original purpose of the scope was to enable zooming in on your gun, at a cost of 1 cell per zoom. Sights would enable auto-aiming at enemies for a limited amount of shots, similar to how the Silencer works. Finally, the remote camera would act as you'd expect, it would allow you to view an area through the camera, and would beep in the player's speakers if damaged. Other powerups included ideas such as a Geiger counter that helped identify close enemies, speed boosts, personal teleporters, and low gravity belts. Some of these ideas would be revisited in Quake III: Arena."

vault_early_stim = "Early Stimpack"
vault_early_stim_desc = "This stimpack would go on to be redesigned to look more like the adrenaline powerup. This item would make it pretty far with a fairly complete skin, before being replaced with the final version."

vault_early_nuke_desc = "The Nuke was an early grenade that would be thrown by the player. As the name implies, this item would be thrown by a player, and after a short countdown it would explode, taking out a large area of whoever was nearby.

Quake II was originally planned to add a third medium variant, but by the time development ended, both large and small ammo types would be removed in favor of one level of pickup per ammo type.

vault_berserker = "Berserker"
vault_berserker_desc = "He has a metal spike as one arm, a hammer as another, and moves very quickly.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: This bald mutha is one deadly freak. He may hit the dirt easy, but he'll get up and is relentless in his pursuits."

vault_black_widow_standing = "Black Widow"
vault_black_widow_standing_desc = "She appears to be high-ranking within the Strogg hierarchy, which means she has been around and has been victorious.

vault_daedalus_desc = "This is a more powerful version of the Icarus. He shoots an upgraded Blaster from his shoulder-mounted lasers. He also utilizes the Power Screen to blunt the force of your attacks.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: Basically they're a flying platform for double barrel Blasters.

vault_guardian_console_desc = "It appears to have been constructed from a Tank Commander's torso, wired into a massive pair of mechanical legs. Two large weapon assemblies extend from its shoulders. Commonly, the Guardian launches continuous four-round bursts of hyper blaster fire in the player's direction from its right weapon mount. The Guardian will also use the laser mounted on its left shoulder against players who are a greater distance away. If the player gets too close to the Guardian it will attempt to kick or stamp them, dealing massive amounts of damage.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Hard\nComments: Due to the massive damage dealt by its melee attack, it is advisable to keep your distance."

vault_gunner = "Gunner"
vault_gunner_desc = "The fighting elite for the Strogg, outfitted with a powerful machine gun and an automatic grenade launcher.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: This cybernetic terror eats Mutants for breakfast before coming to work - on you.

vault_gunner_commander = "Gunner Commander"
vault_gunner_commander_desc = "If the Gunner is the fighting elite, the Gunner Commander is the elite of the elite.

The Commander is also issued with Power Armor as standard, and has multiple melee attacks.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: The Gunner Commander may be an elite unit, but they still go down when shot like everyone else.
