vault_logo = "Quake II Logo"
vault_logo_desc = "Quake II wasn't supposed to be a sequel. Other than the technology, the only thing Quake and Quake II have in common is the name and logo.  However, id needed to design the product packaging and they wanted to integrate the logo into the cinematic. After several failed attempts to come up with a name that was cool and could be trademarked, id ran out of time, and opted to call it Quake II. The second nail was added to the Quake logo, and it was done. Quake would continue afterwards with Quake III: Arena, but it was designed to be a successor to the free multiplayer focused update of QuakeWorld, than a continuation of either Quake title."

vault_biggun = "Big Gun"
vault_biggun_desc = "The Strogg reach Earth by generating and traveling through a black hole. This assault on Earth is depicted in the 2007 release of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Quake II is the follow-up story of Operation Overlord, Earth's plan to travel through the black hole and destroy the generator using a massive airstrike. In the way, however, is a defense system called the Big Gun. The idea of the Big Gun was inspired by the 1961 movie, \"The Guns of Navarone.\" In the movie, a World War II commando unit is selected to take out massive Axis defense guns on the Island of Navarone. In Quake II, Operation Overlord is a large muti-target assault that includes destroying the Black Hole Generator, a Gravity Well, the Strogg Defense Fleet, and the Big Gun itself."

vault_hangar = "Hangar"
vault_hangar_desc = "Although the final version of the Hangar bares little resemblence to this original concept, the design for the Strogg defense aircraft that can be seen flying by were created from this piece. An early Strogg ship based on this concept is also available in the Development section of the id Vault."

vault_imperial_city_desc = "The core of the Stroggos civilization is the capital city of Cerberon. This highly defended complex is built into the base of an enormous crater, Crater Majoris. Between the northern plains and the southern sea of Stroggos, Cerberon contains the major defense, communication, and political controls for the Strogg civilization. At the southern tip of Majoris is a second crater called Crater Minor. Crater Minor contains the defense base complex for the city of Cerberon."

These first levels are pretty typical of Strogg military construction, but have seen some destruction as a result of Earth's counter-attack. The first level in the game has been expanded on in this release based on materials found in the Quake II development archive. A new outdoor area that fills in the area between the two sections of base, and connects to the stream in the original level was restored."

Quake II had the most concept art out of the early id titles, since cinematics had to be finished far in advance of the game. These weapon sketches go from earliest very quick scribbles to pencil shaded and inked versions. Many of these designs made it relatively unchanged to the final, while others look completely different. Among the sketches, the original concept for the Disintegator can be spotted, which would go on to be used for the expansion pack weapon, the Plasma Beam."

vault_doc_desc = "Two pages from an otherwise missing design document, containing descriptions of the units and needed art assets. While the original Quake had most of the artists and level designers creating their own episodes in isolation, only to be pieced together at the end in different episodes, Quake II was planned from the start to have a more cohesive progression of levels. These pages, which were well-loved by evidence of multiple coffee mug rings, cover the City and Palace units, near the end of the game."

vault_monorail_desc = "The Strogg are a heavily industrialized civilization, and their monorail system is evidence of this.

Trains on their rail lines are often used as a device to allow the player to transition from one unit to the next while above or underground."

vault_texpaint = "Texpaint"
vault_texpaint_desc = "Texpaint was an internal tool created for the purposes of creating skin textures for models by drawing directly on 3D models. While artists have access to a wealth of tools today for dealing with complex UV mappings, tools were primitive back then, and tools like Texpaint helped the id artists create more complex models compared to the first title."

vault_area_map_desc = "A marked up version of the Stroggos planet surface, as seen panned around during the cinematic sequences. Much of the 3d modeling and texture is low quality, as it was never intended to be viewed outside of the 320x240 cinematic videos. The path is roughly the path taken of the player throughout the main campaign."

vault_e3_lab_desc = "By June 1997, Quake II was in the process of switching game code from QuakeC, to native code. The version at E3 more closely resembles Quake II as we know it today, while internally a version of Quake II existed that more resembled the original game. This HUD using Quake 1 graphics can be seen in official screenshots as it was one of the last things to be implemented. Being shown in the midst of a major rewrite, the AI was simple and the player would often get caught up on walls and other surfaces."

vault_e3_campaign_desc = "These are the original maps included in the trade show demo version of the game, modified to work on the final version of the engine.

vault_early_tech = "Early Technician"
vault_early_tech_desc = "An early version of the Technician, with a best attempt at fitting what the skin would have been at the time of development. This iteration of the Technician sported an array of prodding and grabbing tools, popping out and fidgeting about at random."

vault_early_flyer_desc = "A near final version of the Flyer, which would be completed ten days after this iteration. A simpler texture, and in-progress skin with a more mechanical take, while the final Flyer would take on more organic forms including a face."

Several alternate skins were prototyped, with this particularly red one chosen to display here. This version of the Mutant is dated as late as September 1997, less than two months before the final version."

vault_gnorta = "Gnorta"
vault_gnorta_desc = "The Gnorta is an enemy that was cut before a skin or animations were created. This model, with no skin or animations is all that remains. It appears to be an enemy with a turtle-like shell, and would scuttle low to the ground."

vault_shocker = "Shocker"
vault_shocker_desc = "The Shocker is another enemy that did not make it past an initial prototype model. It appears to integrate aspects of the Infantry, Gunner, and Berserker, however it is also unknown what role it may have served, and was seemingly cut relatively early on in development."

vault_early_blaster = "Early Blaster"

vault_early_ship_desc = "An early version of a Strogg fighter ship, from before skinning of the model started. This model would stay relatively true to the final version, and is similar to the ship depicted in the \"Hangar\" concept art."

vault_early_male = "Early Male Player"
vault_early_male_desc = "This early version of the male player model is relatively close to the final version visually. Many of the animations would be unused however, with variants for swimming horizontally, elaborate death animations featuring lost limbs, and animations for pushing objects around in the environment. Quake III Arena would eventually feature unique swimming animations, however it is likely a lot of these animations went unused in Quake II due to time."

vault_early_female_desc = "An early mesh of the female player model, featuring a different hair style, and an early version of her silhouette."

vault_early_inf = "Early Infantry: Pale"

This one features a smaller barrel, but showing more of the gun's base itself, before eventually becoming just the larger, higher resolution barrel.

vault_early_sg2 = "Early Shotgun 2"
vault_early_sg3 = "Early Shotgun 3"
vault_early_sg_desc = "Three variations of the in-progress Shotgun skin, dated from June 1997. Different textures were being tested, before settling on the cooler tones, without the rust texture.

vault_unused_items_desc = "Player inventory and upgrades were originally intended to be a bigger part of the game. The original purpose of the scope was to enable zooming in on your gun, at a cost of 1 cell per zoom. Sights would enable auto-aiming at enemies for a limited amount of shots, similar to how the Silencer works. Finally, the remote camera would act as you'd expect, it would allow you to view an area through the camera, and would beep in the player's speakers if damaged. Other powerups included ideas such as a Geiger counter that helped identify close enemies, speed boosts, personal teleporters, and low gravity belts. Some of these ideas would be revisited in Quake III: Arena."

vault_early_stim = "Early Stimpack"
vault_early_stim_desc = "This stimpack would go on to be redesigned to look more like the adrenaline powerup. This item would make it pretty far with a fairly complete skin, before being replaced with the final version."

vault_early_flares = "Unused Flares"
vault_early_flares_desc = "These flares would be used with the Flare Gun, whose model would eventually go on to be reused for the Grapple.

vault_early_nuke = "Unused Nuke"
vault_early_nuke_desc = "The Nuke was an early grenade that would be thrown by the player. As the name implies, this item would be thrown by a player, and after a short countdown it would explode, taking out a large area of whoever was nearby.

vault_early_ammo_desc = "In DOOM and Quake, ammo came in two variants: large and small. Quake II was originally planned to add a third medium variant, but by the time development ended, both large and small ammo types would be removed in favor of one level of pickup per ammo type. Most of these ammo types were far along before being cut, likely to reduce the amount of pickups, with Quake II having more ammo types compared to original Quake."

vault_arachnid_console = "Arachnid (Console)"
vault_arachnid_console_desc = "The Arachnid is one of the toughest non-boss enemies found in the console version of Quake II. The Arachnid's dual railguns are fired one after the other, right first, and are capable of outright killing an unprotected player if both shots connect. When in melee range, the Arachnid swings at the player with its arms, using the railguns as improvised clubs.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Hard\nComments: The Arachnid should be a high priority. The accuracy and firing speed of their railguns is dangerous."

vault_berserker = "Berserker"
vault_berserker_desc = "He has a metal spike as one arm, a hammer as another, and moves very quickly.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: This bald mutha is one deadly freak. He may hit the dirt easy, but he'll get up and is relentless in his pursuits."

vault_black_widow_standing = "Black Widow"
vault_black_widow_standing_desc = "She appears to be high-ranking within the Strogg hierarchy, which means she has been around and has been victorious. Her experience can be seen in her armaments; she has multiple weapons at her disposal, and the ability to summon in reinforcements at a moment's notice.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Extreme\nComments: This is what stands in between you and the Gravity Well.

With twin chainguns, a railgun, and a grenade launcher, this flying arsenal is well-equipped to deal with Marines. As if that weren't enough, the Carrier can also teleport in Flyers for extra Marine-gibbing action.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Hard\nComments: They don't call this guy the Carrier for nothing. Make sure to concentrate your fire on it first and then take care of those pesky Flyers."

vault_daedalus_desc = "This is a more powerful version of the Icarus. He shoots an upgraded Blaster from his shoulder-mounted lasers. He also utilizes the Power Screen to blunt the force of your attacks.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: Basically they're a flying platform for double barrel Blasters.

vault_fixbot = "Fixbot"
vault_fixbot_desc = "Better left alone, these hard-working robots can usually be found repairing doors, lights, and other types of equipment.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Easy\nComments: Keep you eye on these guys - though innocent looking they also have the ability to awaken dead Strogg from eternal sleep."

vault_guardian_console = "Guardian (Console)"
vault_guardian_console_desc = "It appears to have been constructed from a Tank Commander's torso, wired into a massive pair of mechanical legs. Two large weapon assemblies extend from its shoulders. Commonly, the Guardian launches continuous four-round bursts of hyper blaster fire in the player's direction from its right weapon mount. The Guardian will also use the laser mounted on its left shoulder against players who are a greater distance away. If the player gets too close to the Guardian it will attempt to kick or stamp them, dealing massive amounts of damage.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Hard\nComments: Due to the massive damage dealt by its melee attack, it is advisable to keep your distance."

vault_gunner = "Gunner"
vault_gunner_desc = "The fighting elite for the Strogg, outfitted with a powerful machine gun and an automatic grenade launcher.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: This cybernetic terror eats Mutants for breakfast before coming to work - on you. He does have one weakness, though. It takes a second for his hand to open up into the machine gun so take advantage of the brief delay."

vault_gunner_commander = "Gunner Commander"
vault_gunner_commander_desc = "If the Gunner is the fighting elite, the Gunner Commander is the elite of the elite. The Gunner Commander is more lethal, shooting projectiles from a modified form of the ETF Rifle. The Commander is also issued with Power Armor as standard, and has multiple melee attacks.\nDefense/Weapon Analysis: Medium\nComments: The Gunner Commander may be an elite unit, but they still go down when shot like everyone else.
